Contains .xml files for the tables loaded into the openrave environment. When doing inverse kinematics, the placement of the tables comes into play.

SDHtable.xml is the table for the real pr2 in Sutardja Dai. The table height is correct, but the distance of the pr2 from the table depends (just make sure there is some space in front of the pr2)

table.xml is the table brought up in gazebo when launching pr2_move_table_object.launch
